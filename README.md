Netflix Dashboard
This repository contains the "Netflix Dashboard," a dynamic data visualization project designed to analyze and present insights from Netflix-related datasets. The dashboard, accessible here, was developed as part of my practical application of skills gained from the "Data Analysis | SQL, Tableau, Power BI & Excel | Real Projects" course on Udemy, completed on September 6, 2025. This project showcases key metrics such as viewer trends, content performance, and regional usage patterns, crafted using Tableau and Power BI, with data extracted and cleaned using SQL and Excel.
Project Overview
The dashboard was built following a 12.5-hour intensive training led by instructor Graeme Gordon, focusing on real-world data analysis techniques. I utilized SQL to query and structure the Netflix dataset, performed data cleaning and transformation in Excel, and created interactive visualizations in Tableau and Power BI to highlight insights like popular genres, watch time distribution, and user engagement. This project reflects my ability to handle large datasets, design intuitive interfaces, and deliver actionable business intelligence.
Technical Approach

Data Extraction: Leveraged SQL to pull relevant data from the dataset.
Data Processing: Used Excel for cleaning and preliminary analysis.
Visualization: Developed interactive charts and dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to present findings effectively.
Design Focus: Emphasized user-friendly navigation and clear data storytelling.

Purpose and Impact
This dashboard serves as a practical tool for understanding Netflix's data landscape, offering insights that could support content strategy or marketing decisions. It demonstrates my proficiency in end-to-end data analysis and visualization, honed through hands-on projects during the Udemy course.
Future Enhancements
I plan to expand this dashboard by integrating additional datasets (e.g., subscription metrics or competitor analysis), optimizing performance with advanced filtering options, and potentially adding real-time data updates. Feedback and contributions are highly encouraged to further improve this project!
